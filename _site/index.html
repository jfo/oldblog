   <hr>
   <span class="post-date">February 09, 2014</span>
   <p>In late 2006, I said goodbye to my friends, and my girlfriend, and my family, and I walked down this passage at the airport in Raleigh, North Carolina, to fly to Japan for two years.</p>

<p><iframe style="float:center;" src="http://www.flickr.com/photos/monkeywithamirror/12426888455/player/" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen>
  </iframe></p>

<p>It was already after CD&#39;s, and she had made me a playlist. I remember - it was this song as I took the picture in the passage, and it was when I took the picture in the passage that I realized I was leaving. August 29, 2006. At 11:05 pm, to be precise... (why don&#39;t I ever properly set the time zone on my cameras, I wonder, now?)</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/GA5Q8u5f0Ks" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>
  </iframe></p>

<p>There were no titles on the list, so for years I didn&#39;t know the name of that song, until shazam at least. But I often think of it when my life is changing; when I&#39;m going somewhere... when things are never going to be the same.</p>

<hr>

<p>When I was in seventh grade, we were all shuffled into the gym to hear the high school jazz band perform. It was fine. It was great. I enjoyed it. But then Gray Currin played Stairway to Heaven. Don&#39;t laugh. I didn&#39;t know yet. I hadn&#39;t seen <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RD1KqbDdmuE">Waynes World</a>; I had never even heard the original song. How could someone barely older than me do that? I was <em>amazed</em>. I wished I could do that. And then, a little voice. My voice. In my head: &quot;<em>Why couldn&#39;t you?</em>&quot;</p>

<p>I was a slightly morose kid. I wasn&#39;t given to flights of fancy... this was a new feeling for me. And so I did it. 3 years later I played the same song in the same gym with the same band. I never stopped playing; I never will stop playing.</p>

<hr>

<p>A little under a year ago, Yuri came back to New York and got a job as a Python developer. I told him how impressed I was (and I <em>was</em>, and I <em>am</em>) - he essentially picked it up on his own, after all. I had always wanted to learn more about computers... they&#39;ve always fascinated me... but it is so much... it is too hard... I couldn&#39;t... I don&#39;t have time...</p>

<p>&quot;Sure you could!&quot; Yuri told me, and he gave me a few little puzzles and problems and riddles. I solved all of them, and then I went online and found some more and I solved those too. And then a week later I found the original Cue programming challenge on a message board, and I stayed up until 7 the next morning solving <em>that</em>.</p>

<p>&quot;Congratulations!&quot; the browser said chipperly &quot;Please send us your resume!&quot;</p>

<p>Hmm.</p>

<p>A little voice.</p>

<hr>

<p>I&#39;ve spent hundreds of hours at the keyboard since last May. I&#39;ve spent dozens of nights playing with code until dawn. I&#39;ve never been able to focus this much on anything else, other than music and my instrument, and tomorrow I get to keep focusing on it with around 60 other people from all over the world and from a crazy cross section of fascinating disciplines... because tomorrow is the first day of <a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/">Hacker School</a>, and I am so excited about it. Introductory emails have been coming in for a while, and I am simply blown away by the people with whom I get to spend the next 3 months- and humbled to be counted amongst them. I have no idea what we&#39;re going to end up working on, though I have some inclinations, but I sure am looking forward to finding out.</p>

<p>Yuri, and Gabe Herrera, and Andrew Madden: Thank you. all three of you offered votes of confidence at the right times. At just the right times.</p>

<p>And a public thanks to the <a href="http://www.wixlounge.com/">Wix Lounge</a>- a place that is, quizzically, what it says on the tin. I spent a <em>lot</em> of days there, and it was a true help.</p>

<p>And to my cohort: I hope the coffee tomorrow is strong, because I think quite a few of us are not going to be sleeping much.</p>

So now I have a software model of a rubik&#39;s cube. But how would I go about writing a program that can manipulate that model from any legal position and solve it?</p>

   <p>After writing the initial iteration of the The Chorder, I started thinking about other systems that I might be able to model, and the rubiks cube seemed perfect. It is visual, easy to conceptualize, and completely contained- any possible combination can be arrived at by starting at the solved cube (the &quot;base case&quot;) and shuffling. All I had to do was model the state of the cube in some sort of data structure and implement the various transformations accurately and the program would be accurate. Easy, right?!</p>

   <p>Have you heard of Derple Derp? It&#39;s the hottest new thing to hit the social networking scene.</p>

<p>Not really.</p>

<p>Really, it&#39;s the title I gave the <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/" target="_blank">Hartl Rails Tutorial</a> Sample App on the version of it that I made so that it didn&#39;t say <strong>&quot;SAMPLE APP&quot; </strong>in huge, giant, letters on every page load while I was working in coffee shops or the <a href="http://www.wixlounge.com/" target="_blank">Wix lounge</a>. I decided to keep it that way... everything else is exactly the same as the canonical Sample.</p>
