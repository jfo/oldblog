   <h2 class="post-title"><a href="/recursion.html">Recursion in 3 steps.</a></h2>
   <hr>
   <span class="post-date">February 27, 2014</span>
   <p>Recursion is not as difficult a concept as people would have you believe when you first start out. Textbook definition says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Recursion in computer science is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem (as opposed to iteration).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, great. If you&#39;re a beginner, that&#39;s not <strong>super</strong> helpful, and if you ask your grizzled old dev friends about it they are likely to either start yammering about how awesome recursion is from a to the metal on the stack implementation perspective or advise you to not worry about it. Either response maintains the mystery.</p>

<p>So what is recursion? At a basic level, you are using recursion if you are calling a function from inside of itself. It makes more sense as a demonstration.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s define a function that returns nothing (in Python, because why not):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="python language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">myfunc</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">None</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now here is a function that does nothing but call itself:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="python language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">myfunc</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">myfunc</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Calling this will produce the following, almost immediately:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded
</code></pre></div>
<p>So, we&#39;ve succeeding in making recursion occur, to no external effect. What&#39;s happening under the hood? The computer takes your instructions and dutifully executes them. Whenever you give it a new instruction (including as a subsection of the original instruction) it puts the original instruction aside to complete the new instruction. Once it completes the new instuction (and all sub instructions of that one, as well...) it picks up the original instruction and completes its steps.</p>

<p>It is easy to imagine literally piling these nested instruction sets up on a table top- just you know, stacking them up. Stacking. Stack.</p>

<p>Eventually you&#39;re going to run out of room- maybe you hit the ceiling, or something. Once you have no more space to set aside these instruction sets, you have run out of stack, and you will no longer be able to keep track of new nested instructions. You will have reached your maximum recursion depth.</p>

<p>A recursive function MUST have a way to know when to stop calling itself. This is called a &quot;base case&quot; and it looks something like this... if we pass in a number and evaluate against that:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="python language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">myfunc</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">some_number</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">some_number</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s">&quot;Base case&quot;</span>
    <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">myfunc</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">some_number</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>But here is the tricky part. Each new call to the function is passing in the same number. If we start at 0, it will not reach the recursive call. But if we do not start at 0, we have the same problem as before. Every time you call the function inside of itself, therfore, you want to change the value that you are passing into it.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="python language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">myfunc</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">some_number</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">some_number</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s">&quot;Base case&quot;</span>
    <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">myfunc</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">some_number</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This will cause the function calls to move towards the base case. Assuming you have enough space on your table to stack up all of those instructions, the variable will eventually reach 0 and propogate back through the stack of instructions that you had set aside.</p>

<p>Astute readers, of course, may ask what would happen if you start from a negative number. Clearly, subtracting one will never reach 0. The function also needs a way to exit if it finds itelf pursuing a line of instructions that will never reach a base case...</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="python language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">myfunc</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">some_number</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">some_number</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="ne">StandardError</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;Value will never reach base case&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">elif</span> <span class="n">some_number</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">print</span> <span class="s">&quot;Base case&quot;</span>
    <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">myfunc</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">some_number</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This function has &quot;knowledge&quot; about a situation that would cause it to enter an infinite recursive loop. It moves towards a base case and will eventually reach it, provided it has enough space to store the stack of instructions as it is executing them. What if it doesn&#39;t?</p>

<p>If I call this function passing in 998, it works fine. 999, I will get a stack overflow. It still runs out of memory! The way different languages deal with this problem is dependant on the priorities and style of the language, and is beyond the scope of this simple post. Suffice to say that for many problem spaces, recursion can be overkill where iteration would work fine. Here is the same function iteratively:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="python language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">myiter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">some_number</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">some_number</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
      <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="ne">StandardError</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;This will subtract forever&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">some_number</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span>
      <span class="n">some_number</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">some_number</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span>

    <span class="k">print</span> <span class="s">&quot;You made it!&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This does not have to keep track of how many instructions it has set aside. It simply mutates the given variable in the specified way until it reaches the condition set. Once again, we have caught numbers that would never reach 0 before they reach the loop... (errors cut off the code evaluation at the point at which they were raised.)</p>

<p>Languages like Python and Ruby implicitly discourage recursiveness through their design decisions. Functional languages like Scheme and Clojure (from the lisp lineage) have built in optimizations to make recursion less brittle. Hilariously, a common technique is tail call optimization, which under certain circumstances turns a recursive function into an iterative one at the machine level.</p>

<p>Recursion is powerful but can be conceptually difficult at first. But... for some problem spaces it is by far the best computational method. </p>

<p>More on that later!</p>

   <p>Alright, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNydDzz-JQ">here is a video</a> from a gig last night with <a href="http://www.kellyashmusic.com/">Kelly</a>.</p>

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/BLNydDzz-JQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>It was really, surprisingly great sounding in that little room, thanks in no small part to Eileen Goddard behind the sound board- which is totally weird because she light designed a bunch of shows I played for in college like one billion years ago, and I tend to run into randomly in the strangest places.</p>

   <p>So, week one is already over, and it went by pretty quickly.</p>

<iframe src="//instagram.com/p/kUplN5kjDi/embed/" width="612" height="710" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>

<p>Anyway, week in review- what have I learned so far, concretely?</p>

<ul>
<li>&#39;git add -p&#39; for reviewing each and every change you made before committing it</li>
<li>&#39;git commit --amend&#39; for opening up your last commit and making changes to it</li>
<li>&#39;Ctrl+R&#39; to search through old CLI commands</li>
<li>&#39;diff&#39;</li>
<li>what a &#39;trie&#39; is</li>
<li>what a &#39;queue&#39; is</li>
<li>depth-first vs breadth-first search</li>
<li>that vim doesn&#39;t source my .zshrc by default</li>
<li>state-machine</li>
<li>void returns in C</li>
<li>the basics of list comprehensions in Python</li>
<li>etc etc etc... and on and on and on...</li>
</ul>

<p>these are just <em>facts</em>, and random things, but they are actual tidbits of knowledge that I actually remember because I learned them &#39;in the stream,&#39; as it were.</p>

<p>This is a funny place to be, but it feels really natural... everything you do here is one hundred percent your own decision. It&#39;s incredible to note that <em>everyone</em> is working <em>all the time</em>. The real time chat we use is constantly on fire with threads about all kinds of arcana from assembly specs to keyboard reviews to places to eat lunch. </p>

<p>Also, I got to try an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcOMOWRMnA">Oculus Rift</a>, which was <em>totally rad</em>.</p>

<p>The question of what exactly to work on while here is a big one- but there is certainly no lack of ideas. Every single person I talked to was working on something interesting, and the huge variance in people&#39;s backgrounds virtually guarantees that you can both learn something from and teach something to anyone in the room.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been going through the last couple of chapters of <a href="http://www.nand2tetris.org/">nand2tetris</a> and hope to have the book done in the next couple of days so that I don&#39;t have to think about it anymore. It&#39;s been an <em>incredible</em> learning experience, but I do want to maximize the time that I spend pairing and shipping while I&#39;m here, and nand feels like it&#39;s best done on one&#39;s own and in isolation (at least, that&#39;s the way I&#39;ve enjoyed doing it... though the toolset that I composed with Ruby is <em>really, really</em> ugly and could use a refactor really badly!)</p>

<p>More later on specifics... I want to write a booklist of all the things I&#39;ve read so far and all the things I hope to read, and hopefully in the next couple of weeks I&#39;ll be able to get some clarity on what exactly I want to work towards and what I want to learn- or at least narrow the scope of those things to a manageable point. </p>

<p>Tonight, though, it&#39;s my birthday. So I&#39;m trudging out in the cold and getting some sushi. Had a preemptive small party last weekend with lots of singing and nerdery, and I&#39;ll post some videos from that pretty soon. It&#39;s pretty fun to get a room full of musicians drunk and then play &quot;lets listen to a song once and then play a fully realized arrangement of it yay lets go GO HARMONY EVERYWHERE! </p>

   <p>In late 2006, I said goodbye to my friends, and my girlfriend, and my family, and I walked down this passage at the airport in Raleigh, North Carolina, to fly to Japan for two years.</p>

<p><iframe style="float:center;" src="http://www.flickr.com/photos/monkeywithamirror/12426888455/player/" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen>
  </iframe></p>

<p>It was already after CD&#39;s, and she had made me a playlist. I remember - it was this song as I took the picture in the passage, and it was when I took the picture in the passage that I realized I was leaving. August 29, 2006. At 11:05 pm, to be precise... (why don&#39;t I ever properly set the time zone on my cameras, I wonder, now?)</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/GA5Q8u5f0Ks" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>
  </iframe></p>

<p>There were no titles on the list, so for years I didn&#39;t know the name of that song, until shazam at least. But I often think of it when my life is changing; when I&#39;m going somewhere... when things are never going to be the same.</p>

<hr>

<p>When I was in seventh grade, we were all shuffled into the gym to hear the high school jazz band perform. It was fine. It was great. I enjoyed it. But then Gray Currin played Stairway to Heaven. Don&#39;t laugh. I didn&#39;t know yet. I hadn&#39;t seen <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RD1KqbDdmuE">Waynes World</a>; I had never even heard the original song. How could someone barely older than me do that? I was <em>amazed</em>. I wished I could do that. And then, a little voice. My voice. In my head: &quot;<em>Why couldn&#39;t you?</em>&quot;</p>

<p>I was a slightly morose kid. I wasn&#39;t given to flights of fancy... this was a new feeling for me. And so I did it. 3 years later I played the same song in the same gym with the same band. I never stopped playing; I never will stop playing.</p>

<hr>

<p>A little under a year ago, Yuri came back to New York and got a job as a Python developer. I told him how impressed I was (and I <em>was</em>, and I <em>am</em>) - he essentially picked it up on his own, after all. I had always wanted to learn more about computers... they&#39;ve always fascinated me... but it is so much... it is too hard... I couldn&#39;t... I don&#39;t have time...</p>

<p>&quot;Sure you could!&quot; Yuri told me, and he gave me a few little puzzles and problems and riddles. I solved all of them, and then I went online and found some more and I solved those too. And then a week later I found the original Cue programming challenge on a message board, and I stayed up until 7 the next morning solving <em>that</em>.</p>

<p>&quot;Congratulations!&quot; the browser said chipperly &quot;Please send us your resume!&quot;</p>

<p>Hmm.</p>

<p>A little voice.</p>

<hr>

<p>I&#39;ve spent hundreds of hours at the keyboard since last May. I&#39;ve spent dozens of nights playing with code until dawn. I&#39;ve never been able to focus this much on anything else, other than music and my instrument, and tomorrow I get to keep focusing on it with around 60 other people from all over the world and from a crazy cross section of fascinating disciplines... because tomorrow is the first day of <a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/">Hacker School</a>, and I am so excited about it. Introductory emails have been coming in for a while, and I am simply blown away by the people with whom I get to spend the next 3 months- and humbled to be counted amongst them. I have no idea what we&#39;re going to end up working on, though I have some inclinations, but I sure am looking forward to finding out.</p>

<p>Yuri, and Gabe Herrera, and Andrew Madden: Thank you. all three of you offered votes of confidence at the right times. At just the right times.</p>

<p>And a public thanks to the <a href="http://www.wixlounge.com/">Wix Lounge</a>- a place that is, quizzically, what it says on the tin. I spent a <em>lot</em> of days there, and it was a true help.</p>

<p>And to my cohort: I hope the coffee tomorrow is strong, because I think quite a few of us are not going to be sleeping much.</p>
