   <p class="post-date">November 12, 2013</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://communities.ptc.com/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/2-172419-27077/puzzles_rubiks_cube-13771.jpg" width="400" height="268" /></p>
So now I have a software model of a rubik&#39;s cube. But how would I go about writing a program that can manipulate that model from any legal position and solve it?</p>

<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-779"></a></p>

<p>This was also a major nerd snipe on myself, much like the fizzbuzz in brainfuck that ate up a full weekend a few weeks ago. At first, I figured that this was out of my paygrade-- so many better solvers have been written. I&#39;m not even that good of a cuber! I learned to solve it in college but only ever learned one method- it works every time but is not the most efficient solution by any means. I would have to learn new algorithms and strategies if I wanted to write a program that would work well. But then...</p>

<p>Really, the point of the exercise was not to write a fast, efficient program- but rather to attempt to model my own logical process when I solve an &quot;analog&quot; cube. For that- this was a perfect test problem, so that&#39;s what I did.</p>

<p>As I said in the last post, implementing the basic transformations was pretty easy. Using those methods in series to build helper methods that perform even complex algorithms was as simple as stringing them together on a single Cube object and then returning that object. Like this:
<blockquote>
<pre>  #Re-orients cubies of [0][4], [0][6], and [0][8] without affecting anything else.
  def last_move
    self.rr.d.d.r.f.d.d.fr.ur.f.d.d.fr.rr.d.d.r.u
    self
  end</pre>
</blockquote>
That&#39;s the most long winded combination in my repertoire, used to reorient the final cubies to their proper faces.</p>

<p>I planned out the solution by thinking of the steps I use normally:
<ol>
    <li>top cross</li>
    <li>corners next to the top cross</li>
    <li>second level middles</li>
    <li>last level cross</li>
    <li>last level corners</li>
</ol>
So I implemented solving methods for each of these. Basically, each step repeats a set of motions that don&#39;t change the effects of the previous step until some condition is satisfied. Here is the top cross method for an example:
<blockquote>
<pre>  #Solves for cross on first layer. Affects all other layers. 
  def cross_solve 
    downcross = []
    i = 1
    until @cube[0][1] == @cube[0][0] &amp;&amp; @cube[0][3] == @cube[0][0]  &amp;&amp; @cube[0][5] == @cube[0][0] &amp;&amp; @cube[0][7] == @cube[0][0]</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">  until downcross.include?(@cube[0][0]) 
     downcross = []
     self.rr.d.r.l.dr.lr.turn
     downcross = [@cube[5][1],@cube[5][3],@cube[5][5], @cube[5][7]]
     i += 1
     if i &amp;gt; 10
       self.turn until @cube[0][1] != @cube[0][0] 
       self.l.b 
       i = 1
     end
  end

  until @cube[5][3] == cube[0][0]
    i =0
    self.d

    if i &amp;gt; 59 
      self.print
      gets
      end
      i+=1
  end

  until @cube[0][7] != @cube[0][0]
    self.u
  end
 self.f.f
 downcross = []
end

until @cube[4][3] == @cube[4][0] &amp;amp;&amp;amp; @cube[1][5] == @cube[1][0]
  until @cube[1][5] == @cube[1][0]        
    self.u
  end
  self.turn if @cube[4][3] != @cube[4][0]
  i += 1

  if i &amp;gt; 10   
    self.cross_swap
    i = 1
  end
end

if @cube[2][7] != @cube[2][0]
  self.cross_swap
end

self
</code></pre></div>
<p>end</pre>

It is a very dumb, brute force solving method. I also included several conditionals that trip if the loop has iterated a certain number of times; these act like a tilt- jogging things around just enough to change whatever was causing the loop to lock up.</p>

<p>And so on down the line, until the cube is solved.</p>

<p>The final method to call all of these layers in sequence looks something like this:
<blockquote>
<pre>  #solve invokes all layer solving methods in sequence, solving from any legal state 
  def simple_solve
    testarray = [] 
    @cube.each {|side| testarray &lt;&lt; side.uniq}
    return self if testarray.flatten.length == 6</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">self.cross_solve.corners_solve.second_layer_solve.top_cross.top_corners
self
</code></pre></div>
<p>end</pre>
</blockquote>
Note that it always checks to see if the cube is ALREADY solved before mucking it up!</p>

<p>Going through the process of modeling my own behavior was enlightening. The computer is very, very stupid, but if you give it explicit enough instructions that are able to handle any possible cases, it can do almost any logical process.</p>

   <p class="post-date">November 12, 2013</p>
   <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.memphisflyer.com/binary/db6e/1351792080-rubiks-cube-original.jpg" width="252" height="252" /></p>

<p>After writing the initial iteration of the <a title="&quot;The Chorder&quot; prototype" href="http://www.jeffalanfowler.com/blog/the-chorder-prototype/">chorder</a>, I started thinking about other systems that I might be able to model, and the rubiks cube seemed perfect. It is visual, easy to conceptualize, and completely contained- any possible combination can be arrived at by starting at the solved cube (the &quot;base case&quot;) and shuffling. All I had to do was model the state of the cube in some sort of data structure and implement the various transformations accurately and the program would be accurate. Easy, right?!</p>

<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-767"></a></p>

<p>And actually, it was pretty easy... not at first, necessarily- there was a fair amount of head scratching about how, exactly, I was going to store the state of the cube at any one time (I&#39;m not convinced I picked the best method, either... but more on that later...)</p>

<p>I eventually settled on a two dimensional array containing 6 other arrays (one for each face of the whole cube) of 9 elements each (one for each square on each face.) More about the structure from the README:
<blockquote>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The @cube attribute contains 6 arrays of 9 elements, each array describes one side of the cube like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">@cube[0] - top
@cube[1] - left
@cube[2] - back
@cube[3] - right
@cube[4] - front
@cube[5] - bottom
</code></pre></div>
<p>The first element @cube[x][0] in any array describes the center square of that face, and remains static in relation to the other sides, just as a real cube&#39;s center square would. </p>

<p>The remaining array elements from [1] - [8] start at &quot;12 o&#39;clock&quot; and move clockwise. Thus: Even numbers are middle cubies and odd numbers are always corner cubies.</p>

<p>&quot;12 o&#39;clock&quot; is constant amongst all sides of the cube, and refers to what &quot;north&quot; would be if the cube was unfolded into two dimensions like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">    1
5,4,0,2
    3
</code></pre></div>
<p>When cube orientation procedures are applied, the &quot;address&quot; of each side remains consistent with the above diagram, even as the sides themselves represent different numbers. (The sides could just as easily be assigned any symbol or string or whatnott, just as long as each side started off all the same thing, the cube would be in a legal state).</p>

<p>If you created a new cube and then applied Cube#turn, the sides would appear like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">    4
5,3,0,1
    2
</code></pre></div>
<p>But the address of the location of these sides would remain static. This is so that complex move combinations can be applied to a cube regardless of its orientation to the &quot;viewer.&quot;</pre>
</blockquote>
This does have the advantage of offering a static &quot;address&quot; for each mini square on each face of the cube, but doesn&#39;t offer any scalability- I can&#39;t instantiate a cube of an arbitrary size (like Cube.new(n), for example) because the relationships between the different faces is defined in the methods that act upon them, and not in the data structure itself.</p>

<p>After the data structure was designed, implementing the transformations was fairly straightforward. there are only 6 basic moves- each face can be turned clockwise once (turning a face counterclockwise is the same as turning it clockwise three times). here is the method for turning the top face clockwise once:
<blockquote>
<pre>def u
    cubetemp = Marshal.load(Marshal.dump(@cube))</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">cubetemp[1][4] = @cube[4][2]
cubetemp[1][5] = @cube[4][3]
cubetemp[1][6] = @cube[4][4]

cubetemp[4][2] = @cube[3][8]
cubetemp[4][3] = @cube[3][1]
cubetemp[4][4] = @cube[3][2]

cubetemp[3][8] = @cube[2][6]
cubetemp[3][1] = @cube[2][7]
cubetemp[3][2] = @cube[2][8]

cubetemp[2][6] = @cube[1][4]
cubetemp[2][7] = @cube[1][5]
cubetemp[2][8] = @cube[1][6]

cubetemp[0][1] = @cube[0][7]
cubetemp[0][2] = @cube[0][8]
cubetemp[0][3] = @cube[0][1]
cubetemp[0][4] = @cube[0][2]
cubetemp[0][5] = @cube[0][3]
cubetemp[0][6] = @cube[0][4]
cubetemp[0][7] = @cube[0][5]
cubetemp[0][8] = @cube[0][6]

@hist &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &#39;u&#39;
@cube = Marshal.load(Marshal.dump(cubetemp))
self  
</code></pre></div>
<p>end</pre>
</blockquote>
Simple- just reassigning all the colors based on how the cube is moving. Notice that, because I didn&#39;t understand deep copying of data, I used the (then magical) &quot;Marshal&quot; incantation to create a duplicate temporary array to operate on before I redumped the transformed state back into the main attribute. If I didn&#39;t do that, the color assignment would happen sequentially on the main data structure and it wouldn&#39;t be able to properly assign the new values.</p>

<p>Marshal, by the way, is Ruby&#39;s serialization module... it takes any type of data and turns it into a simple byte stream. This was totally overkill. I should have just made a brand new deep copied array by using Array#dup, which does the same thing in a simpler, more secure way. Maybe I&#39;ll update that.</p>

<p>You can see the entire source at the <a href="https://github.com/urthbound/rubyks" target="_blank">Github repo</a>. I also wrote a little interface to interact with the model.</p>

<p>I packaged all this up as a Gem and made it available at <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/rubyks" target="_blank">rubygems.org</a> for anyone who wants to make use of my data structure and transformation methods to write their own solver.</p>

   <p>Have you heard of Derple Derp? It&#39;s the hottest new thing to hit the social networking scene.</p>

<p>Not really.</p>

<p>Really, it&#39;s the title I gave the <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/" target="_blank">Hartl Rails Tutorial</a> Sample App on the version of it that I made so that it didn&#39;t say <strong>&quot;SAMPLE APP&quot; </strong>in huge, giant, letters on every page load while I was working in coffee shops or the <a href="http://www.wixlounge.com/" target="_blank">Wix lounge</a>. I decided to keep it that way... everything else is exactly the same as the canonical Sample.</p>

<p>It was definitely a kick in the ass towards the end... I really should have studied up a little more on basic HTTP and maybe taken some looks through the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Rails Guides </a> before tackling it, but it was an immensely worthwhile thing to do. Not only do I have a general overview of a huge swath of rails&#39;s built in functionality, but it was just plain good practice jumping around directories and getting used to the structure of a good app- rails or otherwise. Test driven development was completely new to me, and I can totally see the benefit of goal driven workflows especially when you might be working with multiple people. Not so sure I like rspec much, though... but that just could be because I&#39;m not very good at it yet.</p>

<p>In a way, the whole tutorial provide a sort of mirror to itself by illustrating a large &quot;goal&quot; to be pursued by a n00b dev. I have a much clearer picture in my mind of what the framework is capable of and generally how it goes about doing things, even if a lot of the specifics are a little bit foggy- and I have been using the guide as a reference if I want to try to implement something that I remember being covered in it.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Alright. I have a memory array loaded with the information I need to get going, and I have a program blueprint that I should be able to implement. I only need to be able to use if/else and if. I looked up some algorithms to use for this bit, and these are the ones I settled on:<a id="more"></a><a id="more-706"></a></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">If ...</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>temp0[-]
temp1[-]
x[temp0+temp1+x-]temp0[x+temp0-]+
temp1[temp0-temp1[-]]
temp0[
<strong> 
<i>  code</i>

</strong>temp0-]</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>and If/Else...
<blockquote>
<pre>temp0[-]+
temp1[-]
x[
<strong>   <i>code1</i></strong></p>

<p>temp0-
x[temp1+x-]
]
temp1[x+temp1-]
temp0[
<strong><br>
<i>    code2
</i></strong>
temp0]</pre>
</blockquote>
Note that the inline &quot;variable&quot; names are actually describing whatever location that cell happens to be. When we get to the final code, those plain text names will be appended with the pointer motions necessary to arrive at them. Both of these algorithms were lifted from <a href="http://esolangs.org/wiki/brainfuck_algorithms" target="_blank">here</a>. For every cell I want to evaluate, I need two more cells to hold temporary information. This is why I left two empty cells next to each multiples counter in the last post, and it is also why I&#39;ll need to slap a couple more empty cells onto the beginning of the whole program when we get around to putting in the final &quot;Buzz&quot; block that needs to be nested into the &quot;Fizz&quot; block. But notice! There is already a problem here... for If/Else, this algorithm runs the first block IF the cell it&#39;s evaluating is &quot;TRUE&quot; (meaning it&#39;s holding a value other than 0). For our &quot;Fizz&quot; and &quot;Buzz&quot; statements, we want them to run if the value of the cell is &quot;0&quot;. Sad Trombone. But it&#39;s an easy fix, of course! We just have to invert all the code we had <a title="fizzbuzz in brainfuck, part one" href="http://www.jeffalanfowler.com/blog/fizzbuzz-in-brainfuck-part-one/" target="_blank">before</a>. Just keep that in mind. Lets write the inverted program in psuedo-code and then fill it all in with the specifics...
<blockquote>
<pre>number = 0 </p>

<p>until number == 100 do
  if number % 3 != 0
    if number % 5 != 0
      print number
    else
      print &quot;Buzz&quot;
    end</p>

<p>else
    print &quot;Fizz&quot;</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">if number % 5 == 0
  print &quot;Buzz&quot;
end
</code></pre></div>
<p>end
puts
number += 1
end</pre>
</blockquote>
Keep in mind that we&#39;ve taken care of all the variable assignments and memory allocation in the last post, so this really is all we have left. I&#39;ll upcase the &quot;rubyish&quot; lines and fill in the brainfuck underneath them.

So, that&#39;s basically that. This is super hard to read, because of the crazy syntax and how unreadable brainfuck is, but maybe having it parsed out so much will help some peeps understand it better. I sure learned a hell of a lot about memory allocation, pointers, and logic gates. All in all, now that I have a couple of weeks between it and me, it was worth the time.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, of course you can see the <a href="http://replit.com/Kr0/3" target="_blank">whole annotated program here</a>. This is EXACTLY the same code as the giant block of bf symbols I put in the <a title="fizzbuzz in brainfuck, part one" href="http://www.jeffalanfowler.com/blog/fizzbuzz-in-brainfuck-part-one/" target="_blank">first part</a>, just spread out with indentation etc.</p>

<p>Next time in the brainfuck series: <a href="https://github.com/urthbound/esoteric/blob/master/brainfuckint.rb" target="_blank">writing a compiler / interpreter for brainfuck in ruby. </a> Sometime. But don&#39;t hold your breath. All you brainfuck fans out there. In Ukraine. Don&#39;t think I don&#39;t see your ip&#39;s.</p>

<p>Oh and just to wrap this up: it feels pretty good to say that I am never going to write another fizzbuzz again; FizzBuzz is officially checked of the bucket list.</p>

<p>Goodnight and goodluck, interwebs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I wrote this program a few months ago. It&#39;s visually minimal, but it can generate over a thousand valid chord shapes. I wrote it in Ruby and wrapped it in <a href="http://shoesrb.com/" target="_blank">Shoes</a>. Instead of prettifying the above format, I decided to refactor the whole project and build it into a web app, while extending it&#39;s functionality to include Drop 3, Drop 2/3, and Drop 2/4 voicings and inversions. That&#39;s in the pipes.</p>

<p>I&#39;m  planning to use this as a base from which to write a program that can output properly voice-led arrangements of any jazz tune by reading charts from the <a href="http://musiccog.ohio-state.edu/home/index.php/iRb_Jazz_Corpus" target="_blank">iRb Jazz Corpus</a>, which I&#39;m making good progress with but will elaborate on in a future post.</p>

<p>If you&#39;d like to run this version, you can<a href="http://shoesrb.com/downloads.html" target="_blank"> download the shoes interpreter here</a> and the <a href="http://jeffalanfowler.com/drop/shoeschorder.rb" target="_blank">GUI source code here </a> and open the latter in the former. If you&#39;re command-line savvy, you could also <a href="https://github.com/urthbound/chorder" target="_blank">clone the github repo</a> and run a terminal interface via &quot;$ruby interface.rb&quot; that accesses the same logic.</p>

<p>The left hand side has five main groups of buttons:
<ul>
    <li>root note</li>
    <li>accidental</li>
    <li>chord quality</li>
    <li>inversion</li>
    <li>string set</li>
</ul>
The program will also accommodate open strings and notes that fall above the 12th fret.</p>

<p>Last time, <a title="fizzbuzz in brainfuck, part one" href="http://www.jeffalanfowler.com/blog/fizzbuzz-in-brainfuck-part-one/">this</a>! This time I&#39;ll translate the first half of the &quot;Ruby&quot; code into brainfuck. Oh the anticipation!
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a id="more"></a><a id="more-655"></a></p>
Because every bf interpreter initializes with a completely clean memory slate, we have to set the memory cells we are going to use before we do anything else. I approximated this in Ruby by using variables to stand in for the memory slots and simply assigning them the value necessary. This time, we have to do it manually, and incrementally, but there&#39;s no trick at all to it, just remembering where we are, really. I&#39;ll kind of do this in the order I did it last time, too.
<blockquote>first we go to cell 7 to start
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
and increment it to the hundreds counter
+
same for cell 8; the tens counter
&gt;++++++++++
and cell 9 for the ones counter
&gt;++++++++++</blockquote>
Now the printing cells... cell 10 gets a newline character, which in ascii code is the byte value &quot;10&quot; in decimal (or 0000 1010 in binary).
<blockquote>&gt;++++++++++</blockquote>
Cells 11, 12, and 13 are assigned to the hundreds, tens, and ones printing places respectively. They have to be initialized to 0, but there&#39;s a little trick to it. Remember, we don&#39;t want the byte value to be 0, we want to byte value to be &quot;0&quot;, which is a string that prints the character for zero, not the byte value for zero itself. All three of these cells, then, need the byte value &quot;48,&quot; which is the ascii code for the STRING &quot;0&quot;.
<blockquote>to 11 hold hundreds place &quot;0&quot;
&gt;&gt;
+++++ +++++ +++++ +++++
+++++ +++++ +++++ +++++
+++++ +++</p>

<p>to 12 hold tens place &quot;0&quot;
&gt;
+++++ +++++ +++++ +++++
+++++ +++++ +++++ +++++
+++++ +++</p>

<p>to 13 hold ones place &quot;0&quot;
&gt;
+++++ +++++ +++++ +++++
+++++ +++++ +++++ +++++
+++++ +++</blockquote>
Now we initialize a few cells to ascii values for the letters we will need to print &quot;Fizz&quot; and &quot;Buzz&quot; and &quot;FizzBuzz.&quot; Turns out we only need 5: &quot;FizBu&quot;. I chose to move the pointer all the way to cell 25 to do this one, both so that I would have more space to work with if I needed it for anything else, and more importantly so that I could visually keep track of where my pointer generally was in the program. When I saw a long string of &gt;&#39;s I had an idea of where it all was. So cells 25-29 spell &quot;FizBu&quot;:</p>

<p>Oh, and for all of these I&#39;m using cell 30 as a counter cell to iterate through the incrementer loops. Not so many &quot;++++++++++&quot; etc that way...
<blockquote>Move to cell 25:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>Set 25 to &quot;F&quot; (ascii key &quot;70&quot;)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;+++++ ++[&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;+++++ +++++&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;-]</p>

<p>Set 26 to &quot;i&quot; (ascii key &quot;105&quot;)
+++++ +++++ +[&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;+++++ +++++&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;-]&lt;&lt;&lt;-----&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>Set 27 to &quot;z&quot; (ascii key &quot;122&quot;)
+++++ +++++ ++[&lt;&lt;&lt;+++++ +++++&gt;&gt;&gt;-]&lt;&lt;++&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>Set 28 to &quot;B&quot; (ascii key &quot;66&quot;)
+++++ ++[&lt;&lt;+++++ +++++&gt;&gt;-]&lt;----&gt;</p>

<p>Set 29 to &quot;u&quot; (ascii key &quot;117&quot;)
+++++ +++++ ++[&lt;+++++ +++++&gt;-]&lt;---</p>

<p>Move back to cell 25
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>

<p>Move back to cell 10 to begin program
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</blockquote>
Incidentally- I used cell 10 as my &quot;Home Base&quot; for all of this. After any operation I would reset the pointer back to cell 10 so I had a pretty good idea of where I was. This was super inefficient from a computing standpoint, resulting in a lot of wasted pointer motions, but carpe diem.</p>

<p>Oh!... only one more thing we need to do, and that is to prepare the 3 and 5 multiples finder to 3 and 5, respectively! I put those in cells 1 (for the 3&#39;s counter) and 4 (for the 5&#39;s counter) because each of them needs two helper cells for all the logic we&#39;re going to futz with later on.
<blockquote>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
+++++
&lt;&lt;&lt;
+++
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</blockquote>
We&#39;ve set everything up and our &quot;workspace&quot;, so to speak, is ready to go...
<blockquote>3 0 0 5 0 0 1 10 10 [10] 48 48 48 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 70 105 122 66 117 0</blockquote>
<a href="http://youtu.be/Q5im0Ssyyus" target="_blank">This link</a> will eventually point to the REPL for the above code so you can look at the memory space yourself, but the save function on that web app seems to be broken right now, so until then it will point to a picture of a unicorn or something... I haven&#39;t decided yet.</p>

<p>Also, spoiler alert. At this point when I was setting everything up, I had forgotten to allocate temp cells for the logic of the innermost &quot;if&quot; block that prints &quot;Buzz&quot; after &quot;Fizz&quot;, so I&#39;ll have to add a couple more slots when I get to that bit. The logic part is what I&#39;m really looking forward to trying to explain, because it all makes sense to me but in a pretty jumbled up way so far...</p>

<p>That concludes <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIL-nwJfGgg" target="_blank">the first half of this basketball game</a>, which is a thing that Chuck Mangione says right before starting to play that track on a live album I had in high school. You should totally click through to the video and let the soothing sounds of well orchestrated, innocuous, proto easy listening jazz drizzle into your ears like honey and cream while riding a bike in a park or petting a dog or something.

<p><span>(</span><a href="http://replit.com/Kr0/1" target="_blank">Run that junk.</a><span>)</span></p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago I got it into my pointy little egg-head that I wanted to write a <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/fizzbuzz-the-programmers-stairway-to-heaven.html" target="_blank">fizzbuzz</a> in <a href="http://www.jeffalanfowler.com/blog/how-brainfuck-works/" target="_blank">brainfuck</a>. As with a lot of the stupid ideas that occur to me, I initially dismissed it as a waste of time, as-well-I-had-ought-to-have-done.</p>

<p>&quot;Nahhhhhhh,&quot; past me said to himself, chuckling, &quot;that would be totally, needlessly hard right now, and it would take a lot of time, and anyway I don&#39;t know how I would even START! Unless, maybe, well... I wonder if I could write an if/else... and then if I could do that...maybe with a multiples counter cell...and....&quot;</p>

<p>And so <a href="http://esolangs.org/wiki/brainfuck_algorithms" target="_blank">after a quick googling</a>, I was off. I basically <a href="http://xkcd.com/356/">nerd-sniped</a> myself.
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a id="more"></a><a id="more-595"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I decided the easiest way to go about it was to write fizzbuzz in Ruby, first, and then translate it into brainfuck. Aww Ruby, <a href="http://replit.com/Kr2/1" target="_blank">you so pretty with your little modulos and all that ish.</a> But of course I couldn&#39;t use anything more complicated than an if/else statement, and I had to do everything incrementally by 1, as well... and I could only stop loops by allowing their index counter to reach zero, not when it got to a certain high number like 100... hmmmmmm.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It looks a little unwieldy, but I used numbers spelled out as variable names to stand for the address of the memory cell that I would eventually use in brainfuck. The variables could only be set to numbers, and until loops can only be set to terminate at zero. I started by writing a program that simply counts to 100 without any of the divisor logic.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">First I needed to mark how high I was going to count. We&#39;re going to 100, so I need a 1 in the hundreds loop counter, a 10 in the tens loop counter, and a 10 in the ones loop counter to start with:</p></p>

<blockquote>seven = 1
eight = 10
nine = 10</blockquote>
Those are the indices; they are going to be going down. Now I need the memory slots holding the actual numerals that are going to be printed... including one slot that holds a new line character I can access so not everything comes out all smashed together, because I can't use <code>puts</code>:
<blockquote>ten = "/n"
eleven = 0
twelve = 0
thirteen = 0</blockquote>
Now I'll just create some nested loops to do the counting (up in the printed slots' case and down in the index slots' case):
<blockquote>
<pre>until seven == 0
    until eight == 0
        until nine == 0
            print ten       #prints the newline
            print eleven    #prints the hundreds place
            print twelve    #prints the tens place
            print thirteen  #prints the ones place

            nine -= 1       #decrements the ones index slot
            thirteen += 1   #increments the ones print slot
        end

        nine = 10           #resets the ones place index slot
        eight -=1           #decrements the tens place index slot

        twelve += 1         #increments the tens place print slot
        thirteen = 0        #resets the ones place print slot
    end

  eight = 10                  #resets the tens place index slot
  seven -= 1                  #decrements the hundreds place index slot

  eleven += 1                 #increments the hundreds place print slot
  twelve = 0                  #resets the tens place print slot
end</pre>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://replit.com/Kr7" target="_blank">Okay- still Ruby... ugly, non-Rubyish Ruby, but now it is nothing I can&#39;t do in brainfuck. </a></p>

<p>But we haven&#39;t done the hard part yet- implementing the logic that will filter out the multiples of 3 and 5 and replace them with &quot;Fizz&quot; and &quot;Buzz.&quot; In Ruby or any other higher level language, this program practically writes itself with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation" target="_blank">modulo operation</a>, which returns zero if a number is evenly divisible by another number and leaves no remainder. But brainfuck, of course, doesn&#39;t have this operation, and remember- it&#39;s conditional loops can only be triggered by a &quot;0&quot; in the memory slot that is being evaluated, anyway.</p>

<p>This one took a little bit of thought, but a solution was forthcoming. I add two more index cells:
<blockquote>
<pre>five = 3
six = 5</pre>
</blockquote>
and decrement both of those each time I print a number out- when the &quot;3&quot; index slot reaches zero, I know I have found a multiple of 3 and can use that spot to trigger the code to print &quot;Fizz&quot; (and to reset the index back to 3- or rather 2 actually, since that accounts for the<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-by-one_error" target="_blank"> ol&#39; off by one</a>) instead of the code to print the number. Ditto for &quot;Buzz.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://replit.com/Kr9/1" target="_blank">Here is what all this looks like... </a>now, before printing the number, the program checks to see if it is a multiple of three or five...only when it is not  divisible by either does it print the number itself.</p>

<p>This totally works! But there are some issues- I can&#39;t use elsifs in brainfuck- the algorithms I&#39;ve researched aren&#39;t that sophisticated, and I haven&#39;t implemented &quot;FizzBuzz&quot; for the numbers that are multiples of both- the logic catches them on &quot;Fizz&quot; and skips over the other bits. Also there is some needless repetition with the newlines, though I&#39;m actually going to need some of that later on so I&#39;ll leave it for now.</p>

<p>Ok so I can&#39;t use elsifs to evaluate mutliple possible states... but I CAN do that evaluation in series. I need it to think the following, which I have decided to draw a flow chart for because it is late and I want to play with photoshop for a minute...</p>

God, that&#39;s butt-ugly. I almost didn&#39;t put it up, it&#39;s so ugly. Whatever, you get the idea. It&#39;s two nested if/else statements. I can deal with those<a href="http://replit.com/Kr9/2" target="_blank">! Now it looks like this.</a></p>

<p>Aside from the repetition we are ignoring- there are three problems left. Still no &quot;FizzBuzz,&quot; and when it should make &quot;FizzBuzz,&quot; it throws off the 5&#39;s counter into negative numbers so it never prints Buzz after 15. And it&#39;s not evaluating 100. The first and second problem can be fixed with just one more &quot;if&quot; statement, nuzzled way down in the bowels of our<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code" target="_blank"> increasingly italian </a>program. We know we&#39;ll only have to write &quot;FizzBuzz&quot; if we&#39;ve already written &quot;Fizz,&quot; so anytime we print &quot;Fizz,&quot; we just throw in an extra check against whether or not we need to write &quot;Buzz.&quot; Now, if we write &quot;FizzBuzz&quot;, we will also be resetting the 5&#39;s counter.</p>

<p>Oh and as for the last problem, I just hardcoded printing &quot;Buzz&quot; out at the end instead of &quot;100&quot;, bypassing all the logic, because I&#39;m a filthy, cheating, dirty fraud. YOLO####33<a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-1-phenomenon" target="_blank">3</a>. Also because it will always end up on a multiple of 100, so at least the &quot;Buzz&quot; part will be right. Screw you, 300, 600, and 900!!</p>

So I&#39;ve written the whole program in a way that brainfuck can accommodate. The next step is to translate it. Bleep, bloop, bleep! I&#39;m going to write that in a separate post, because this is getting pretty long. Also if you want to increase the maximum number that you&#39;re evaluating, try changing the initial index of the hundreds place in the above code! It will go for as long as you want it to, because it will just continue to print higher numbers because it is Ruby! brainfuck wouldn&#39;t be able to do that past 999, because we would need to implement a new loop to print the thousands place, because it is printing strings of digits instead of numbers. We&#39;ll get to that next time.</p>

   <p class="post-date">September 20, 2013</p>
   <p>Gabe asked me to write about what I&#39;ve learned in the last six months or so, and how my view of computing and data and tech has changed, so I am going to do that.</p>

<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-575"></a></p>

<p>I didn&#39;t start off as a total n00b, exactly, I would have considered myself <em>almost</em> a power user in a lot of the applications I spent a lot of time in. I definitely have my generation&#39;s affinity for technology, starting from way back when. I was running DOS commands when I was 6, I remember that, and I remember my mom, who was just fearless with new tech, would always have to spend an hour or so hacking around on our old CGA monitored IBM machine before we could get some dumb floppy disk game to work, like &quot;Duck Tales&quot; or &quot;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyTDI2ATb6k&amp;noredirect=1">Commander Keen</a>&quot; or &quot;Duke Nukem.&quot; I remember taking little after school programming courses in elementary- learning <a href="http://repl.it/Kpm/1" target="_blank">rudimentary Qbasic</a>... I remember having a readily apparent baseline of competency for stuff like that... I remember setting up a telnet connection in 4th grade to my friend Ben&#39;s house to instant message each other (I wonder whatever happened to him... Ben from Salem VA...) and freaking out because it was so cool. I&#39;ve often thought and said that if I hadn&#39;t discovered music, I would have probably spent a lot more time with computers in middle and high school; I probably would have gotten way more under the hood about it, at some point. But I never did. The closest I ever got was trying to learn a little HTML in 10th grade, because Mia from across the street was learning it and she was <em>absolutely killing it it was just brutal it was so dying. </em>I never took to it, though, most probably because HTML is ultimately a visual medium, and I didn&#39;t express myself visually in any meaningful way as a teenager (In other words, I sucked real bad). Mia did express herself visually, and does, and is still finding new and various<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/best-designers-in-technology-2013-5?op=1" target="_blank"> its to murder with great vigor and skill </a></p>

<p>And at some point in college, around the time that we were all deciding our majors, deciding on what we &quot;wanted to do&quot; when we &quot;grew up,&quot; and tacitly  supporting the supposition that that decision should or even meaningfully could be made <em>at age 19</em> based on the life experience <em>of a teenager</em>...<em> </em>my idea of what computers are capable of, or rather, what I might be capable of using computers to do, changed subtly.</p>

<p>Andy from down the hall was the only comp sci major I knew, and once he said something about how hard the curriculum was, and how much work it was, and from then on, way back in the back of my mind, I flagged &quot;computer programming&quot; with tags like &quot;difficult&quot; and &quot;specialized&quot; and &quot;a lot of work.&quot;  ... So it never really occurred to me, after that, to learn programming <em>for fun</em>. It became a domain of knowledge that felt closed off, rarified. Besides, I was then as I am now: busy with music (the mode I DID express myself with as a <em>teenager</em>), which is ALSO a highly specialized and challenging skill that takes years of blah blah blah how-could-why spend-do new-stuff bork? This was compounded by my possession of a peculiar combination of procrastination and perfectionism- when I want to learn something I really, really want to learn it starting <em>from the absolute most basic level</em>, and that has often short circuited my curiosity by allowing me to convince myself that it&#39;s not even worth starting something if I&#39;m not going to learn <em>the whole thing all at once</em>. With a little maturity I realize that, while perhaps a noble impulse, this is almost never the best way to approach a body of knowledge; you wouldn&#39;t try to learn Italian by starting with Latin, even though if you did learn Latin first you would probably be <em>wicked sick</em> at Italian <em>wicked quick</em>, but you would have invested way too much time learning the ancillary skill. That isn&#39;t practical on any meaningful scale.</p>

<p>This is all to say, that the  hardest part about this experience so far has been shedding the vague and completely erroneous assumption that programming or development or computer science or whatever the hell you want to call it is somehow inaccessible to me. Because it&#39;s not. At all. It never really was, but it&#39;s never been more accessible than it is now, what with the whole internet thing. Have you heard of this internet thing? It&#39;s crazy. Basically the whole sum of human knowledge, just about, and you carry it around <em>in your</em> <em>fucking pocket</em>. Just for the record: <em>That is not something to be blasé about.</em></p>

<p>And that is the biggest change in my view, as well. That this stuff is approachable. That it&#39;s <em>really fun</em> to model systems and objects and procedures in software. That I can do it, and that all the resources I would need to gain the skills to (someday, after tons of work) do it really well are free-as-in-beer, easy to get, or both.</p>

<hr>

<p>So that is one way to look at what has changed in my mind recently- and in my opinion it is the most profound shift; it is also, I think, not really what Gabe was asking.</p>

<p>The idea that any type of information can be modelled and manipulated using massive streams of binary data is fundamental to computer science. It is literally atomistic. And before, it was the most obscured piece of the puzzle. I knew that that is how computers functioned, I even vaguely understood that programming languages were high level abstractions of that binary data, but I had nooooo ideaaaa at alllll what came between the two,  let alone how logical systems could be constructed. Then I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0735611319">Code.</a></p>

<p>I bought that book completely on a whim. It was the only book in the whole comp sci section that looked good. The cover is gorgeous. Simple. Plain. Turns out it&#39;s a classic, and for good reason. It starts from absolute zero... ZERO. Starting with what a code, any code at all, is, explaining binary and hexadecimal and octal number systems, and theoretical mechanical computational systems, and logic gates. I mean... logic gates, wow. I had no idea, and now I do! Also it&#39;s really clearly written, which I can already tell is a rarity in that genre...</p>

<p>That is not to say that it didn&#39;t get miles above my head at a certain point... probably about half way through after he explained early processor architecture... and I&#39;m looking forward to reading it again when I have more perspective. That is probably now, actually... I read it pretty early on. It just answered so many questions for me... and now I at least have a cursory understanding of computing at every level from UI all the way down to the bits. Cursory... just a basic roadmap, but that&#39;s pretty huge. I wish I had read that book years ago, but then again, I can&#39;t really say for sure that I would have understood it in the same way. But the &quot;magic&quot; is gone, in all the right ways... I don&#39;t think of the computer as a black box anymore, I think of it as a really sophisticated conglomeration of a huge amount of tiny, really unsophisticated processes. That is not to say that it&#39;s not still magical, just not magic.</p>

<p>And so, in the end, I got my fundamental understanding after all. Sort of. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I still don&#39;t know all that much, but I sure know orders of magnitude more than I did.</p>

<hr>

<p>One more thing...</p>

<p>Computing changes really, really fast, but from a consumer&#39;s perspective, it seems to change even faster than it actually does. From the outside in, completely superficial adjustments to user interface and design can seem to transform the entire system. This is really stupid, of course; operating system designers don&#39;t reinvent the wheel with every incremental update, and I shouldn&#39;t have been surprised to learn that OS X Mountain Lion is built on top of the 45 year old UNIX architecture- but I totally was. I was also surprised to learn that so many programming languages have so much in common with each other, and that they generally represent a fairly small number of schools of thought on software design that each also go back decades. In other words, even though there is an enormous amount to learn about, it turns out it is a LOT less than I thought it was, and it&#39;s also all connected in very systematic and understandable ways.</p>

<hr>

<p>I think that covers a lot of the newness... it&#39;s purposefully a little vague on the technical details... those are for future posts.</p>

   <p>I was teaching an 8 year old kid the other day; He&#39;s one of my favorites. He likes hockey and is totally into guitar, and he can already hear the difference between major and minor and sometimes even augmented and diminished triads. Which is pretty impressive!</p>

<p>Anyway, we were playing &quot;She&#39;ll be Comin&#39; Round the Mountain,&quot; or something, and I picked him a little bluegrass version with a break and some old Tony licks I still have knocking around in my ear from back in the day, and he was just loving it, so at the end of the lesson I showed him this bone-crushingly driving Bryan Sutton video:</p>

<p>Me: &quot;Wow, that might not really be that far off a guess!&quot;</p>

<p>Kid: &quot;And you&#39;re probably like,  5000...&quot;</p>

<p>Me: &quot;Hey, I&#39;ll take that, thanks!&quot;</p>

<p>Kid: &quot;Maybe even the top 500!&quot;</p>

<p>Me: ::actually laughing for real real about this:: &quot;Aw shucks!&quot;</p>

<p>Kid: &quot;Is this video almost over??&quot;</blockquote></p>

   <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-539" alt="bf" src="http://www.jeffalanfowler.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/bf.jpg" width="100%" /></p>

<a href="http://mothereff.in/brainfuck-minifier" target="_blank">The ee cummings of esolangs. </a></p>

<p>I got some good advice from <a href="http://piablumenthal.com/" target="_blank">Pia</a>, who writes and makes such cool, cool  looking stuff, and that advice was to treat a blog not like a personal journal, really, but more like a way to provide your future self (at least) with documentation on and about the things that you work on, do, make, etc. etc. etc. I like that idea, thanks Pia.</p>

<p>So here is part one of a two part post on brainfuck, an actual name of an actual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">Turing complete</a> programming language that people use for things. Sort of. Not really though.</p>

<p>I lost my mind last weekend and learned the basics; I wrote a Ruby based interpreter and a FizzBuzz, and when I was done I was unable to focus my eyes which, according to Gabe, is &quot;Totally a thing!&quot;.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/dawn-of-midi">Dawn of Midi<em></em></a> is really good to listen to on day three of staring at something incomprehensible, FYI.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s how it works:</p>

<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-461"></a></p>

<p>brainfuck interpreters recognize only 8 characters (<em>sometimes</em> 9, but not really... back to that later):
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">&lt;   &gt;   +   -   [   ]   .   ,</p>
</blockquote>
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Any and all spaces, extra characters, line breaks, etc, are completely ignored. 100%. The program really looks like a long string with no spaces consisting of just those 8.</p>

<p>How the hell does it work? Well, before moving on, here are some interesting things I learned recently that will make it easier to explain. Also, just as a side note...<i> </i>I <em>loooove</em> little factoids like this, things that I &quot;knew&quot; before, but didn&#39;t  really <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok">grok</a>. Ok. So:</p>

<p>A &quot;bit&quot; is the <em>smallest possible piece </em>of information. It is simply on or off: 1 or 0, true or false. Bit is short for &quot;binary digit&quot;. One bit is one binary digit- and a binary digit, being binary and all that, only has those two possible states.</p>

<p>A &quot;byte&quot; is <em>eight</em> bits. In binary, eight digits provide you with 256 discrete values: 0-255 (0 counts as one of those). Any single byte can have a value anywhere in that range.</p>

<p>Here, I&#39;ll count to 10 in binary:
<blockquote>0000 0000
0000 0001
0000 0010
0000 0011
0000 0100
0000 0101
0000 0110
0000 0111
0000 1000
0000 1001</blockquote>
&nbsp;</p>

<p>You might be able to intuit that if 0 looks like the top number, then 255 will look like &quot;1111 1111&quot;. Of course, there is no need to have all those leading zeroes, really, except to show that that would be the state of those bits in a byte of memory that was holding those values. We&#39;ll just use the decimal numbers for readability, but they can be represented either way and are equivalent. They could also be represented in hex...</p>

<p>This is just like when you go from 0-9 in the ones place and then roll over back to 0 adding 1 to the tens place, except that maximum value in any single spot is &quot;1&quot;. I get it now! Base 2! Also this led to an AHA! moment concerning the<a href="http://www.javascripter.net/faq/rgbtohex.htm"> RGB hexcodes</a> that I have been looking at for years in Photoshop- they are simply three concatenated two-digit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">hexadecimal numbers! </a></p>

<p>Traditionally, the brainfuck &quot;workspace&quot; (if I can call it that?) consists of two simple things: An array of 30,000 memory slots, each containing just one byte (8 bits, all initialized to hold 0), and a pointer that points to just one of those slots at any one time (initialized to the very first slot.) It&#39;s basically a straight software model of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">Universal Turing Machine.</a></p>

<p>Now we can understand what the first four symbols do.
<blockquote>&lt;    moves the pointer to the left, decreasing-ly.</p>

<p>&gt;    moves the pointer to the right, increasing-ly.</blockquote>
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Usually, the location of the pointer will &quot;roll over&quot; if it goes below 0 or above 30,000... (or above whatever the maximum number available is) effectively making the memory cells act like one long circular tape.
<blockquote>+   increments the value of the byte at the current slot</p>

<ul>
<li>   decrements the value of the byte at the current slot</blockquote>
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>So far so good. So here&#39;s a new brainfuck space, I&#39;ll only show 10 spots because I am not going to type 30,000:
<blockquote>[0] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...
^</blockquote>
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pointer starts at one; everything is zero. Now if we ran this code:
<blockquote>+++&gt;&gt;&gt;+&gt;--</blockquote>
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The memory array would end up looking like this:
<blockquote> 3 0 0 1 [254] 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...</blockquote>
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notice that the decrementing of the fifth cell wrapped around to 255 instead of going negative. A lot of modern interpreters don&#39;t stick to the one byte rule, and can hold any value of any size, negative or not. At its most basic, though, one byte per cell is all you would get. Notice also where the pointer ends up- on the last cell it pointed to.</p>

<p>Two more symbols- the input and output.
<blockquote>,   waits for the user to input a value and places it at the current cell</p>

<p>.   outputs the value at the current cell (prints to screen)</blockquote>
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The values 0-255 are mapped to characters using <a href="http://www.asciichart.com">ASCII</a>- so if I wanted a cell to contain the value &quot;103,&quot; I would press &quot;g&quot; (lowercase). Similarly, if the cell had a value of 103 (&quot;0110 0111&quot; in binary, &quot;67&quot; in hexadecimal), and the program read &quot;.&quot; it would print &quot;g&quot; to the screen.</p>

<p>So how you might make a brainfuck program output simple text to the screen- you can have it say <i>anything</i> just using +,- and .</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a super simple hello world:
<blockquote><pre>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.
+++++++..+++.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.
++++++++++++++++++++++++.+++.------.--------.
-------------------------------------------------------------------.</pre></blockquote>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="http://replit.com/K9B" target="_blank">Check it out here and run it.</a></p>

<p>Easy, right? You&#39;ll notice two things. It works great! and.. only the first time! Why is that? Well, we&#39;re only acting on a single cell changing that single value directly until we get to the appropriate ASCII character code for the letter or characterr we want to print, and the cell is not reset between times you run the program, unless you reload the page. Every time you run the code through the interpreter, it starts out at the number the previous instance left it at. In our case: 33 ... which is the value of the exclamation mark. Each time you run the code, that value goes up by 33, printing out gibberish. Notice also that it goes waaaaaaay above 255. This interpreter can hold way more than a single byte, and is printing out Unicode values instead. [Edit: Gabe tells me it&#39;s still ASCII, not Unicode...]</p>

<p>Let&#39;s fix it!</p>

<p>Add a &quot;&gt;&quot; right at the top, before anything else.</p>

<p>Now the very first thing the program does is to move the pointer over just once to start from a fresh cell. Easy! Notice that the memory slots are all filling up with 33&#39;s as well. やった！</p>

<p>But we have two more symbols, and they are the really good ones:
<blockquote>[       if the value of current cell is zero, skip to the matching bracket without executing the code.</p>

<p>]       if the value of the current cell is NOT zero, go back to the opening bracket and execute the code again.</blockquote>
&nbsp;</p>

<p>OMG! LOORPS!</p>

<p>The simplest loop in brainfuck is this one:
<blockquote> [-]</blockquote>
&nbsp;</p>

<p>This code decreases the value of the current cell until it is zero. If you just ran this code and nothing else, it wouldn&#39;t do anything because the cell is initialized at 0, thereby making the program skip the internal parts of the bracket. But if we run this code:
<blockquote> <a href="http://replit.com/K9B/1" target="_blank">+++++ [-]</a></blockquote>
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well, it still <em>looks </em>like it does nothing, but really it increments the value to 5 and then decrements it to zero.</p>

<p>Walk through it:
<blockquote>Increase value of cell to 5
Value of cell is 5 so run the code.
Decrease to 4
Value is not zero so rerun the code
Decrease to 3
Value is not zero so rerun the code
Decrease to 2...</blockquote>
&nbsp;</p>

<p>You get the idea. The loop will run until the value of the cell is zero and then terminate- leaving the final value of everything at zero, leaving no trace, <a href="http://www.burningman.com/environment/resources/lnt.html" target="_blank">like a conscientious burner on the playa</a>.</p>

<p>So in addition to starting each iteration of the program by moving to a &quot;clean&quot; cell, you could also decrement the current cell back to zero (from wherever it might have ended up) by inserting that simple loop before anything else.</p>

<p><a href="http://replit.com/K9B/2" target="_blank">Like this!</a></p>

<p>That&#39;s what the 8 symbols do. That&#39;s it!!! THAT&#39;S ALL IT IS!! But in theory, you can write anything in brainfuck, any kind of program you can possibly write in anything else could be realized. Of course, <a href="http://forum.osdev.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=20967">CAN doesn&#39;t mean SHOULD</a><em>, </em>and writing an OS in brainfuck, while an insanely challenging and interesting and <em></em> curiosity problem, I&#39;m sure, has been likened to trying to build a car by bolting parts onto a skateboard.</p>

<p>One more thing about loops.</p>

<p>You can use a helper cell to iterate a loop a specified number of times. Consider this:
<blockquote> <a href="http://replit.com/K9H">+++++ +++++ [&gt; +++++ +++++ &lt; -]</a></blockquote>
&nbsp;</p>

<p>This loads the first cell (our counter) to 10, then when the loop starts it moves over to cell two to increment 10 times, before moving back to cell one to decrement once. Just like before, it runs the code until the cell reaches zero- but the code within the brackets is affecting the second cell. That little line is the same as this one:
<blockquote> <a href="http://replit.com/K9H/1">&gt; ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;</a></blockquote>
&nbsp;</p>

<p>So that&#39;s brainfuck. Sort of. This is really basic, but that&#39;s how it works. You can write brainfuck code to run if/then statements and if/else statements and all kinds of things.</p>

<p>Oh and PS: some interpreters use &quot;#&quot; as a debugging breakpoint. Whenever the interpreter encounters it, it halts and waits for a signal to continue.</p>

<p>...and because I am an idiot, I neglected to find out that this show was LIVE streamed for free while we performed it, or to tell everyone about it. It was absolutely terrific to be able to play this great and intricate music with such a talented group of people, and big big big big goods to Brittany, who worked SO HARD on this and transcribed the entire record for like a gazillion instruments note for note. I am so sure she is sleeping better now.</p>

<p>The good news is: it was definitely video&#39;d (expertly, from what I&#39;ve heard...) and I should be able to post excerpts pretty soon. Until then, here is a Youtube of the original performance in it&#39;s entirety :</p>

<p><object width="420" height="315" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="//www.youtube.com/v/ZFwnlCudeC0?hl=en_US&amp;version=3" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="420" height="315" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="//www.youtube.com/v/ZFwnlCudeC0?hl=en_US&amp;version=3" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always liked this band... when I heard them in college it was just <em>so strange...</em> the harmonies weren&#39;t really that complex, although they were certainly sophisticated, but the harmonic motion was just really unconventional- it&#39;s amazing how hard it was for my ear to resolve parallel motion minor chords back then, and the textures were so sparse and delicate... the whole thing feels like funky dance music on downers, and what a great time!</p>

<p>More on that later, maybe, for now I&#39;m sticking to my <a title="FILDI" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYlCVwxoL_g" target="_blank">FILDI</a></p>

   <p>I will not let this blog go to its grave with only a few posts. I can do this. I can find a reason to write something, and then something else, and then something else.</p>

<p>What&#39;s been happening? So, so much. All at once. I have a million things in my head, project wise, and many of them are not even just unrelated but are in <em>completely unrelated fields.</em> That&#39;s a good thing; I&#39;ve always been a fan of learning a lot of different things, and a huge critic of that stupid old &quot;jack of all trades&quot; chestnut (that would be a good post, actually...) - but it is also pretty hard to keep everything in my head all at once when it becomes tenuous and difficult to connect all the dots together. I can certainly have some sympathy for picking one thing and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?%7Bgoogle:acceptedSuggestion%7Doq=do+a+barrel+roll&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=do+a+barrel+roll">barreling ahead</a> with it...</p>

<p>Ok, so. A new show with Megan (see DIRECTLY below, or <a href="http://www.jeffalanfowler.com/?p=350">here</a>) on Tuesday the 8th. Once again at Shapeshifter (excellent room!) but this time with a stripped down band, just strings and small rhythm section. And Megan, of course.</p>

<p>Despite bleeding snot from my face the other night, I played bass with Toby Singer with HIS album release show at Littlefield...</p>

<p>And it was good. More on that later, probably touring a little in October!</p>

<p>Lest I leave out one of the more exciting things done during the blog blackout... I also played some guitar for Jared Saltiel...</p>

<p>Re: photography, I&#39;ve recently done a couple of photoshoots for excellent and talented friends&#39; albums:</p>

<p><a href="http://stevepicjazz.com/index.html">Steve Picataggio</a> - fantastic and swinging drummer and UNBELIEVABLY nice dude- looking forward to hearing that one!</p>

<p>and <a href="http://www.kellyashmusic.com/index">Kelly Ash</a> - Kelly has great pitch!! I need to get a copy of this one too... (full disclosure: I also sang some vocal harmonies on this one!)</p>

<p>what else, what else... A photo I took of Tenor Saxophonist Ted Brown was printed in the June issue of JazzTimes! Unfortunately it is only in the print edition, but if you see the issue take a look at it.</p>

<p>Ok, I have to go RIGHT NOW to teach. But in the interest of notching down the perfectionism, I&#39;m going to go ahead and post this one and finish it up later with another post.</p>

<p>Well, Mara, they&#39;re mine, from a series I did last year futzing with old polaroids. If I had the inclination I would say &quot;distressing expired filmstock.&quot;</p>

<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-342"></a></p>

<p>That was last year around this time, or a little later, in a burst of uncharacteristically fretless output, that I&#39;d like to get to more often, pun intended and I mean both ways this is a poorly written sentence.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mostly I pressed the chemicals around in there using a wacom stylus and a flat edge on a salt shaker. I&#39;ve always been rotten at drawing, but this was mostly abstract enough for me to do it. I really loved the effect so I made about 60 of them, although the vast majority are, shall we say, aesthetically inferior <em>ahemcrapahem</em>... but enough turned out to make it worth the time.</p>

<p>There is also something rattling around in my brain about being open to inspiration from unconventional media, like when my microwave hums a closed position major seventh chord, which is really weird cause it only does that when I put vegetarian gyoza in there... go figure...</p>

<p>I finished a nine panel one that the title bar is taken from first:</p>

<p>And then made I think 5 or 6 to mail to some folks, but I don&#39;t remember who got what, so maybe let me know in the comments.</p>

<p>Also, best of luck with your own V-I, we&#39;re all in this together.</p>
