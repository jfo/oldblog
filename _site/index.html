   <p>Alright, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNydDzz-JQ">here is a video</a> from a gig last night with <a href="http://www.kellyashmusic.com/">Kelly</a>.</p>

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/BLNydDzz-JQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>It was really, surprisingly great sounding in that little room, thanks in no small part to Eileen Goddard behind the sound board- which is totally weird because she light designed a bunch of shows I played for in college like one billion years ago, and I tend to run into randomly in the strangest places.</p>

<p>Some code coming up, to.</p>

   <hr>
   <span class="post-date">February 15, 2014</span>
   <p>So, week one is already over, and it went by pretty quickly.</p>

<iframe src="//instagram.com/p/kUplN5kjDi/embed/" width="612" height="710" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>

<p>Anyway, week in review- what have I learned so far, concretely?</p>

<ul>
<li>&#39;git add -p&#39; for reviewing each and every change you made before committing it</li>
<li>&#39;git commit --amend&#39; for opening up your last commit and making changes to it</li>
<li>&#39;Ctrl+R&#39; to search through old CLI commands</li>
<li>&#39;diff&#39;</li>
<li>what a &#39;trie&#39; is</li>
<li>what a &#39;queue&#39; is</li>
<li>depth-first vs breadth-first search</li>
<li>that vim doesn&#39;t source my .zshrc by default</li>
<li>state-machine</li>
<li>void returns in C</li>
<li>the basics of list comprehensions in Python</li>
<li>etc etc etc... and on and on and on...</li>
</ul>

<p>these are just <em>facts</em>, and random things, but they are actual tidbits of knowledge that I actually remember because I learned them &#39;in the stream,&#39; as it were.</p>

<p>This is a funny place to be, but it feels really natural... everything you do here is one hundred percent your own decision. It&#39;s incredible to note that <em>everyone</em> is working <em>all the time</em>. The real time chat we use is constantly on fire with threads about all kinds of arcana from assembly specs to keyboard reviews to places to eat lunch. </p>

<p>Also, I got to try an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcOMOWRMnA">Oculus Rift</a>, which was <em>totally rad</em>.</p>

<p>The question of what exactly to work on while here is a big one- but there is certainly no lack of ideas. Every single person I talked to was working on something interesting, and the huge variance in people&#39;s backgrounds virtually guarantees that you can both learn something from and teach something to anyone in the room.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been going through the last couple of chapters of <a href="http://www.nand2tetris.org/">nand2tetris</a> and hope to have the book done in the next couple of days so that I don&#39;t have to think about it anymore. It&#39;s been an <em>incredible</em> learning experience, but I do want to maximize the time that I spend pairing and shipping while I&#39;m here, and nand feels like it&#39;s best done on one&#39;s own and in isolation (at least, that&#39;s the way I&#39;ve enjoyed doing it... though the toolset that I composed with Ruby is <em>really, really</em> ugly and could use a refactor really badly!)</p>

<p>More later on specifics... I want to write a booklist of all the things I&#39;ve read so far and all the things I hope to read, and hopefully in the next couple of weeks I&#39;ll be able to get some clarity on what exactly I want to work towards and what I want to learn- or at least narrow the scope of those things to a manageable point. </p>

<p>Tonight, though, it&#39;s my birthday. So I&#39;m trudging out in the cold and getting some sushi. Had a preemptive small party last weekend with lots of singing and nerdery, and I&#39;ll post some videos from that pretty soon. It&#39;s pretty fun to get a room full of musicians drunk and then play &quot;lets listen to a song once and then play a fully realized arrangement of it yay lets go GO HARMONY EVERYWHERE! </p>

   <h2 class="post-title"><a href="/corridor.html">it is as a long corridor</a></h2>
   <hr>
   <span class="post-date">February 09, 2014</span>
   <p>In late 2006, I said goodbye to my friends, and my girlfriend, and my family, and I walked down this passage at the airport in Raleigh, North Carolina, to fly to Japan for two years.</p>

<p><iframe style="float:center;" src="http://www.flickr.com/photos/monkeywithamirror/12426888455/player/" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen>
  </iframe></p>

<p>It was already after CD&#39;s, and she had made me a playlist. I remember - it was this song as I took the picture in the passage, and it was when I took the picture in the passage that I realized I was leaving. August 29, 2006. At 11:05 pm, to be precise... (why don&#39;t I ever properly set the time zone on my cameras, I wonder, now?)</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/GA5Q8u5f0Ks" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>
  </iframe></p>

<p>There were no titles on the list, so for years I didn&#39;t know the name of that song, until shazam at least. But I often think of it when my life is changing; when I&#39;m going somewhere... when things are never going to be the same.</p>

<hr>

<p>When I was in seventh grade, we were all shuffled into the gym to hear the high school jazz band perform. It was fine. It was great. I enjoyed it. But then Gray Currin played Stairway to Heaven. Don&#39;t laugh. I didn&#39;t know yet. I hadn&#39;t seen <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RD1KqbDdmuE">Waynes World</a>; I had never even heard the original song. How could someone barely older than me do that? I was <em>amazed</em>. I wished I could do that. And then, a little voice. My voice. In my head: &quot;<em>Why couldn&#39;t you?</em>&quot;</p>

<p>I was a slightly morose kid. I wasn&#39;t given to flights of fancy... this was a new feeling for me. And so I did it. 3 years later I played the same song in the same gym with the same band. I never stopped playing; I never will stop playing.</p>

<hr>

<p>A little under a year ago, Yuri came back to New York and got a job as a Python developer. I told him how impressed I was (and I <em>was</em>, and I <em>am</em>) - he essentially picked it up on his own, after all. I had always wanted to learn more about computers... they&#39;ve always fascinated me... but it is so much... it is too hard... I couldn&#39;t... I don&#39;t have time...</p>

<p>&quot;Sure you could!&quot; Yuri told me, and he gave me a few little puzzles and problems and riddles. I solved all of them, and then I went online and found some more and I solved those too. And then a week later I found the original Cue programming challenge on a message board, and I stayed up until 7 the next morning solving <em>that</em>.</p>

<p>&quot;Congratulations!&quot; the browser said chipperly &quot;Please send us your resume!&quot;</p>

<p>Hmm.</p>

<p>A little voice.</p>

<hr>

<p>I&#39;ve spent hundreds of hours at the keyboard since last May. I&#39;ve spent dozens of nights playing with code until dawn. I&#39;ve never been able to focus this much on anything else, other than music and my instrument, and tomorrow I get to keep focusing on it with around 60 other people from all over the world and from a crazy cross section of fascinating disciplines... because tomorrow is the first day of <a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/">Hacker School</a>, and I am so excited about it. Introductory emails have been coming in for a while, and I am simply blown away by the people with whom I get to spend the next 3 months- and humbled to be counted amongst them. I have no idea what we&#39;re going to end up working on, though I have some inclinations, but I sure am looking forward to finding out.</p>

<p>Yuri, and Gabe Herrera, and Andrew Madden: Thank you. all three of you offered votes of confidence at the right times. At just the right times.</p>

<p>And a public thanks to the <a href="http://www.wixlounge.com/">Wix Lounge</a>- a place that is, quizzically, what it says on the tin. I spent a <em>lot</em> of days there, and it was a true help.</p>

<p>And to my cohort: I hope the coffee tomorrow is strong, because I think quite a few of us are not going to be sleeping much.</p>

So now I have a software model of a rubik&#39;s cube. But how would I go about writing a program that can manipulate that model from any legal position and solve it?</p>
