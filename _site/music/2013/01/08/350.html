<p>So, I&#39;m really excited about this show tonight...</p>

<p>Cause I&#39;m playing bass, which is fun, and it&#39;s a cd release, and her first cd release, and that&#39;s really amazing too, but also because the music is good and the arrangements are great and the band is tight and it just feels really good all around.</p>

<p>I often do this dumb thing where I forget to invite people to shows when I actually want them to come, so even though this is wicked late and all, if you&#39;re able to make it tonight to the show at<a href="http://www.shapeshifterlab.com/"> Shapeshifter Lab</a>, well then that would just be swell. They&#39;re also Live streaming it! At 10 pm! WICKED SICK.</p>

<p>In addition to being a good friend and colleague, Megan was also one of my <a href="http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/234/739/fa5.jpg">very very first portrait sittings</a> Here&#39;s one from like one million years ago, I mean it was really hard taking all those pictures while still wearing our diapers, but I think we did alright.</p>

<p>Megan, looking forward to it, and congratulations on your CD release!</p>
