<div class="post">
<p>I will not let this blog go to its grave with only a few posts. I can do this. I can find a reason to write something, and then something else, and then something else.</p>

<p>What&#39;s been happening? So, so much. All at once. I have a million things in my head, project wise, and many of them are not even just unrelated but are in <em>completely unrelated fields.</em> That&#39;s a good thing; I&#39;ve always been a fan of learning a lot of different things, and a huge critic of that stupid old &quot;jack of all trades&quot; chestnut (that would be a good post, actually...) - but it is also pretty hard to keep everything in my head all at once when it becomes tenuous and difficult to connect all the dots together. I can certainly have some sympathy for picking one thing and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?%7Bgoogle:acceptedSuggestion%7Doq=do+a+barrel+roll&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=do+a+barrel+roll">barreling ahead</a> with it...</p>

<p>Ok, so. A new show with Megan (see DIRECTLY below, or <a href="http://www.jeffalanfowler.com/?p=350">here</a>) on Tuesday the 8th. Once again at Shapeshifter (excellent room!) but this time with a stripped down band, just strings and small rhythm section. And Megan, of course.</p>

<p>Despite bleeding snot from my face the other night, I played bass with Toby Singer with HIS album release show at Littlefield...</p>

<p>And it was good. More on that later, probably touring a little in October!</p>

<p>Lest I leave out one of the more exciting things done during the blog blackout... I also played some guitar for Jared Saltiel...</p>

<p>Re: photography, I&#39;ve recently done a couple of photoshoots for excellent and talented friends&#39; albums:</p>

<p><a href="http://stevepicjazz.com/index.html">Steve Picataggio</a> - fantastic and swinging drummer and UNBELIEVABLY nice dude- looking forward to hearing that one!</p>

<p>and <a href="http://www.kellyashmusic.com/index">Kelly Ash</a> - Kelly has great pitch!! I need to get a copy of this one too... (full disclosure: I also sang some vocal harmonies on this one!)</p>

<p>what else, what else... A photo I took of Tenor Saxophonist Ted Brown was printed in the June issue of JazzTimes! Unfortunately it is only in the print edition, but if you see the issue take a look at it.</p>

<p>Ok, I have to go RIGHT NOW to teach. But in the interest of notching down the perfectionism, I&#39;m going to go ahead and post this one and finish it up later with another post.</p>

<p>Grrrr....</p>
