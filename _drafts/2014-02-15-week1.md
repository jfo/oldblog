So, week one is already over, and it went by pretty quickly!

There is _so_ much to work on. Every single pair I did this week sparked new ideas or little projects or BIG projects... I had meant to blog more, likeyado, but also I have been waiting on the blaggragator to get fixed so that I can submit these posts there. 

Anyway, week in review- what have I learned so far, concretely?

- 'git add -p' for reviewing each and every change you made before committing it
- 'git commit --amend' for opening up your last commit and making changes to it
- 'Ctrl+R' to search through old CLI commands
