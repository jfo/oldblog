So we're just going to skip that whole thing this time, okay good good.

I always feel like if music hadn't snatched my nerd up, I would have ended up a coder somewhere along the way... I remember my dos commands and qbasic from waaaaaay back, Â but while Mia was across the street from me writing javascript frames (<span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="https://d27fcql9yjk2c0.cloudfront.net/assets/2089425/original/peace.gif?1284526602" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">remember that especially ugly one with the rotating 3d peace sign? Jesus</span></a>.</span>), the best I could ever muster was a geocities page with a maroon background and a grainy photo of some guy doing a grind.

(I've always wished I could find that page, again, but since that is impossible, <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://www.jeffalanfowler.com/blog/geocities/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">I've recreated it here</span></a></span>. Shut up, whatever, I was thirteen.)
