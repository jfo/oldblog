So, I'm really excited about this show tonight...

Cause I'm playing bass, which is fun, and it's a cd release, and her first cd release, and that's really amazing too, but also because the music is good and the arrangements are great and the band is tight and it just feels really good all around.

I often do this dumb thing where I forget to invite people to shows when I actually want them to come, so even though this is wicked late and all, if you're able to make it tonight to the show at<a href="http://www.shapeshifterlab.com/"> Shapeshifter Lab</a>, well then that would just be swell. They're also Live streaming it! At 10 pm! WICKED SICK.

In addition to being a good friend and colleague, Megan was also one of my <a href="http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/234/739/fa5.jpg">very very first portrait sittings</a> Here's one from like one million years ago, I mean it was really hard taking all those pictures while still wearing our diapers, but I think we did alright.

Megan, looking forward to it, and congratulations on your CD release!
