I was teaching an 8 year old kid the other day; He's one of my favorites. He likes hockey and is totally into guitar, and he can already hear the difference between major and minor and sometimes even augmented and diminished triads. Which is pretty impressive!

Anyway, we were playing "She'll be Comin' Round the Mountain," or something, and I picked him a little bluegrass version with a break and some old Tony licks I still have knocking around in my ear from back in the day, and he was just loving it, so at the end of the lesson I showed him this bone-crushingly driving Bryan Sutton video:

<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/UG9Az8fOkeg" height="360" width="480" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>

And then this happens:

<a id="more"></a><a id="more-552"></a>
<blockquote>Kid: "... is he better than you?"

Me: "Oh, yeah, totally, he's one of the best in the world!"

Kid: "Well what are you?"

Me: "I don't know, man, what are YOU?"

Kid: ::thinks intently for a few moments:: "I think I'm probably about number 5,000,000."

Me: "Wow, that might not really be that far off a guess!"

Kid: "And you're probably like, Â 5000..."

Me: "Hey, I'll take that, thanks!"

Kid: "Maybe even the top 500!"

Me: ::actually laughing for real real about this:: "Aw shucks!"

Kid: "Is this video almost over??"</blockquote>
